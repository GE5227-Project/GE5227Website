        <p>
            The proliferation of GIS from the hands of a few established institutions to the hands of the everyday person has presented exciting opportunities for novel developments and innovations within the discipline.  <br><br>

Location-based technologies now offer a great plethora of applications and integration into different fields. The use and integration of immersive Augmented Reality games (such as Pokemon Go) with GIS has hinted at the breadth of possibilities emerging from the convergence between 3D landscapes and GIS. Conversely, the introduction of StoryMaps and ArcGIS Online has also set powerful precedents in the analysis and visual comprehension of data and research. <br><br>

Ranked as the 5th Geography department in the world according to QS World University Rankings in 2021, the Geography department at the National University of Singapore prides itself for its extensive history of academia and accolades in one of the most dynamic and cosmopolitan cities in the world since its inception in 1928. Aside from its exciting palette of disciplines in tropical environmental change, social and cultural geographies, and political and economic geography, the Department offers a dedicated graduate programme in Applied Geospatial Information Sciences which blends learning of geospatial sciences into key areas of contemporary geography. <br><br>

As MSc Applied GIS students who are privileged to be on board of this dynamic and multi-disciplinary learning experience, we are here to reveal some snippets of the work that we do and the skills we have acquired as part of this course. Having learnt front-end web development languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this team of four will bring you on an interactive journey about ourselves and our interests by incorporating UI design with skills we’ve picked up through the duration of our course. <br><br>

Further information about us can be found by toggling on the navigation bar pegged to the banner of this page. Do experiment with the different pages around this website and interact with the elements on this page to know more about our background, academic inclinations and interests. <br><br>

We hope you have a whale of a time while scrolling through our website.
